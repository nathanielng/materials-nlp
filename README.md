# Scientific Papers NLP

This is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine for scientific papers.
For the time being, development will be prioritized towards the following

1. Elsevier API at [dev.elsevier.com/](http://dev.elsevier.com/)
2. [Crossref API](https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-delivery/rest-api/) via [crossref_commons_py](https://gitlab.com/crossref/crossref_commons_py)

Tentative APIs currently under exploration:
1. [CORE](https://core.ac.uk/services/api/)
2. [Microsoft Academic Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/)

Initial work will focus on on Materials Science,
via the [mat2vec](https://github.com/materialsintelligence/mat2vec) library
with a general direction to eventually cover at least the following 4 areas:

1. Materials Science
2. Engineering
3. Physics
4. Chemistry
